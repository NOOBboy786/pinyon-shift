# Building

The supported build environment is 64-bit Windows 10 or 11 with PowerShell 5.1
or newer, a DirectX 12-capable GPU, an internet connection, and about 25 GB of
free disk space.

Run:

```powershell
.\tools\setup-preview.ps1 -IsoPath C:\path\to\your-disc.iso
```

The script performs six reproducible stages:

1. verifies the exact ISO size and SHA-256 against `config/supported-dumps.json`;
2. installs Visual Studio Build Tools when missing and downloads pinned portable
   tools whose hashes are recorded in `config/release-toolchain.json`;
3. initializes the pinned ShiftGlue submodule, or clones the same revision for a packaged launcher;
4. extracts the disc and generates translated source under `.local/`;
5. configures and compiles `out/build/win-amd64-release/pinyon_shift.exe`; and
6. prepares shaders from your local game files and validates them in a hidden,
   muted startup run before enabling play.

The launcher also checks graphics on every launch, including existing installs.
Valid artifacts are reused; missing, damaged or outdated artifacts are prepared
automatically for the selected resolution and graphics driver. Preparation uses
separate temporary game states and never copies or resets your save. If it is
interrupted, reopening the launcher retries it. No shader commands are needed.

The original ISO is opened read-only and is never changed. Setup can be safely
run again after a failure; completed downloads and extraction are reused after
verification. Everything produced from the disc is ignored by Git.

To verify only the image:

```powershell
.\tools\setup-preview.ps1 -IsoPath C:\path\to\your-disc.iso -VerifyOnly
```

To rebuild after changing host or ShiftGlue code:

```powershell
.\tools\build-preview.ps1
```

To build the distributable launcher package:

```powershell
.\tools\package-launcher.ps1
```

That package contains a self-contained launcher executable and a source archive.
It deliberately excludes the compiled preview, generated translations, and all
game content.
