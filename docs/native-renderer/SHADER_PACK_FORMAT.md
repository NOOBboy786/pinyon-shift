# FH1 native shader pack format

Version 2 is the Forza Horizon 1 D3D12 runtime renderer input. It stores the
native shader container plus the texture and sampler binding metadata that
ReXGlue normally derives while translating Xenos microcode. A matching entry
therefore bypasses `DxbcShaderTranslator` completely.

This is deliberately title-specific. The runtime looks only for title
`4D5309C9` and selects an exact pack by translator version, GPU vendor, D3D12
translation flags, and integer render scale:

```text
4D5309C9.fh1-native-v2.<vendor>.<flags>.<scale-x>x<scale-y>.pnsp
```

## Manifest

`tools/native-shader-pack.py` consumes one or more UTF-8 V2 manifests. Multiple
manifests are merged only when their translation configurations are identical;
duplicate identities must contain identical data.

```json
{
  "schema": "pinyon-shift.native-shader-pack.v2",
  "backend": "d3d12",
  "translation": {
    "translator_version": "20260827",
    "vendor_id": 4318,
    "bindless_resources": true,
    "edram_rov": false,
    "gamma_render_target_as_unorm8": false,
    "msaa_2x": true,
    "draw_resolution_scale_x": 2,
    "draw_resolution_scale_y": 2
  },
  "entries": [{
    "stage": "pixel",
    "guest_hash": "0123456789ABCDEF",
    "specialization_mask": "000000000016003F",
    "bytecode": "dxil/pixel.dxil",
    "sha256": "64 hexadecimal digits",
    "texture_bindings": [{
      "bindless_descriptor_index": 0,
      "fetch_constant": 3,
      "dimension": 1,
      "is_signed": 0
    }],
    "sampler_bindings": [{
      "bindless_descriptor_index": 0,
      "fetch_constant": 3,
      "mag_filter": 1,
      "min_filter": 1,
      "mip_filter": 1,
      "aniso_filter": 0
    }],
    "used_texture_mask": 8
  }]
}
```

The stable identity is `(stage, guest_hash, specialization_mask)`. The runtime
never substitutes another specialization. Bytecode paths must remain below the
manifest directory, begin with D3D container magic `DXBC`, match their SHA-256,
and be at most 16 MiB. Packs are bounded to 65,535 entries and 512 MiB.

Build and verify locally:

```powershell
python .\tools\native-shader-pack.py build `
  .\.local\native-renderer\capture-a\shader-manifest.json `
  .\.local\native-renderer\capture-b\shader-manifest.json `
  --output .\.local\native-renderer\fh1.pnsp
python .\tools\native-shader-pack.py verify `
  .\.local\native-renderer\fh1.pnsp
```

## Binary layout

All integers are unsigned little-endian. A 112-byte header is followed by
88-byte sorted entries and 16-byte-aligned payloads. The header contains magic
`PNYNSHPK`, version `2`, sizes and offsets, entry count, payload size, a SHA-256
of the complete index and payload, translator version, vendor, translation
flags, render scales, and three zero reserved words.

Each entry stores stage, bytecode format, guest hash, specialization mask,
payload offset and bytecode size, texture/sampler counts, used-texture mask, a
zero reserved word, and bytecode SHA-256. Its payload is bytecode followed by
16-byte texture bindings and 24-byte sampler bindings.

The producer and runtime independently validate configuration, sizes, ranges,
alignment, hashes, binding bounds, texture masks, sorted uniqueness, and
consistent layouts across specializations before exposing bytecode.

## Runtime and retirement gates

`PipelineCache::TranslateAnalyzedShader` first performs the exact pack lookup.
On a hit it installs bytecode and bindings and continues through normal root
signature and pipeline creation without Xenos shader translation. During
explicit offline corpus production, a miss may use the compatibility translator
and is observable by the capture callback.

Normal FH1 execution always enforces the retirement gate; there is no runtime
setting or launcher argument that can disable it. A miss is marked
terminal-invalid and reported as a GPU error before the translator can run.
The normal `rexgpu-fh1.dll` is compiled without the DXBC shader compiler.
Translation exists only in the explicit, unstaged `rexgpu-fh1-producer.dll`
target used with the locally extracted disc corpus. `launch-preview.ps1`
temporarily stages that producer only for a `-DiscShaderCorpusDir` run and
removes it afterward. The FH1 runtime is fixed to native host render targets,
so the alternate ROV shader ABI and its synthetic depth shader are absent too.
`tools/run-fh1-render-test.py
--require-zero-shader-misses` independently requires a zero-entry capture
summary, so tests prove both that the runtime did not fall back and that the
expected scene completed.

## Public-source boundary

Extracted guest shaders, translated bytecode, manifests containing guest shader
identities, and completed packs are locally derived artifacts; they must remain under `.local`.
Repository policy continues to forbid `.dxil`, `.dxbc`, and
`.pnsp`. The public repository contains the format, producer, loader, and tests.
The pack does not enable guest draw or resolve suppression.

## Current qualification

The initial `.xsh` / `.xpso` proof produced 721-entry packs at every supported
integer scale. The asset-derived producer supersedes those observed-cache packs.
The complete current NVIDIA packs are:

| Scale | Entries | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1x | 22,012 | 468,825,976 | `1636179BF8633D7406C7C3C735DD600C0C05666D8A8A8CAC188433730A38C026` |
| 2x | 22,012 | 473,489,272 | `D6E62162510BE0EDFC0CA4D1624B498F51024F7BC5AC2597A23C37929E030A3E` |
| 3x | 22,012 | 473,489,272 | `53288ADF3C958C994D857CC2DEEF8877A0EA1DF4E3B89207B7E6AF18778C83B0` |

That pack passed unattended 2560x1440 race, free-roam, SELECT-map, pause/resume,
photo-mode, and combined HFR mode tests with zero runtime shader translations.
The strict HFR session `20260904T043852Z-p44060` produced 73.426 source
frames/s, zero duplicate presents, and title time at 1.004x wall time. A
negative run without the pack was rejected by the runtime gate, proving that
strict mode cannot silently invoke the compatibility translator.

Strict 1x HFR session `20260904T044521Z-p45072` also completed the combined
mode route with zero misses and duplicate presents. Capture-light strict 3x
session `20260904T045529Z-p556` rendered a true 3840x2160 world frame with zero
misses, 75.066 source frames/s, 74.860 presents/s, zero duplicate presents,
and title time at 0.995x wall time. This completes the scale matrix for the
current NVIDIA translator configuration; other GPU vendors remain unproven.

`tools/extract-fh1-shader-corpus.py` now reads loose assets and FH1's LZX track
archives, finding 3,349 unique raw programs in 4,293 containers. It combines
the embedded 34 vertex declarations with the retail vertex templates to emit
8,377 deterministic patched variants, producing 11,726 programs total.

At 2x, automated corpus session `20260904T055222Z-p28564` translated 9,600
vertex and 12,098 pixel specializations with zero failures. The merged pack has
21,984 entries, is 472,656,904 bytes, and has SHA-256
`572CDA43FEAF4B98B77B850034E28C54D67D95DEE8B942E9D2050CF605897C7F`.
Strict session `20260904T055452Z-p33360` used that pack without an `.xsh` seed,
captured zero misses, rendered 86.478 unique source frames/s, emitted no
duplicate presents, and kept title time at 1.007x wall time.

The corresponding strict no-seed 1x session `20260904T060200Z-p47700`
captured zero misses at 1280x720, produced 87.904 source frames/s, and kept
title time at 1.006x wall time. Strict 3x session
`20260904T060433Z-p11356` captured zero misses at 3840x2160, produced 75.343
source frames/s with zero duplicate presents, and kept title time at 0.996x
wall time. `tools/launch-preview.ps1` now verifies and stages the matching
local scale pack for ordinary runs and enables the strict no-translation gate.

Ordinary launches also stage the FH1-only startup catalog from
`.local/native-renderer/fh1-native-prewarm/cache` when present. It contains the
read-only `fh1-native-shaders-v2.bin`, `fh1-native-pipelines-v1.bin`, and
`fh1-gpu-prewarm-v3.txt` allowlist; all three files are required and verified
by SHA-256 while staging. `build-fh1-gpu-prewarm.py --legacy-cache` converts the
last qualified ReXGlue capture into those native startup inputs. The v2 shader
catalog stores each FH1 shader's raw identity plus the constant maps, vertex
binding strides, output masks, register requirements and memory-export facts
that drawing still needs. Each bounded record has its own XXH3 checksum and the
runtime requires a sorted, unique, exact-EOF catalog. Parsed instructions,
disassembly, labels and translator-only control-flow analysis are not stored.
Normal runs therefore neither execute `AnalyzeUcode` nor open or mutate
`.xsh`/`.xpso` stores. These remain local game-derived artifacts. The
current qualified catalog contains 461 pipeline hashes, 73,781 draw identities
and 690 copy identities.

Schema 21 makes the FH1 native route unconditional and removes its former V4
enable/disable setting. Strict session `20260904T070431Z-p24828` verified the
combined HFR/UI route after migration with zero shader translations, zero
synchronous pipeline creations and zero prewarm fallback draws.

The separate precompiled-shader CVar is also retired. Normal FH1 execution now
rejects pack misses structurally; only the local, observer-backed disc-corpus
producer may execute the translator. Positive session
`20260904T070857Z-p34300` passed the complete combined route with zero runtime
translations and zero synchronous pipeline creation. A no-pack negative smoke
session `20260904T071055Z-p35632` failed on explicit precompiled misses while
recording zero translated shaders, proving direct launches cannot fall back.

The completed v2 analysis catalog contains 11,628 unique guest shaders
(8,409,800 bytes, SHA-256
`09F6FDC0FBD9961BA000A2B30B3839FA9D4BA0292D09F7FA436EC4B761D0613E`).
It unions the complete disc corpus, the finite generated/system title seed,
and runtime-generated car-selection programs found by the deterministic race
route. Shipping sessions at all three scales then completed the full event and
race with zero shader misses. The binary gate additionally requires
`AnalyzeUcode` to be absent from the runtime and present only in the offline
producer.
